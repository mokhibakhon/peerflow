-- ============================================================
-- PeerFlow — reliability
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql and
-- migration-mvp.sql. Additive: one column and one function. Without it the
-- score simply does not appear anywhere.
--
-- WHY
-- The one thing you need to know about a stranger before you agree to meet
-- them every week is whether they turn up. Everything else on a profile is
-- what they intend to do; this is the only part that is what they did.
--
-- WHY IT IS A FUNCTION AND NOT A COLUMN
-- Reliability is read about other people, and other people's session rows are
-- not readable — the RLS on public.sessions stops there, correctly, because a
-- calendar is private. A security-definer function is the way to answer "how
-- often does this person turn up" without also answering "when are they
-- busy": it returns four numbers per person and never a row.
--
-- A stored column would need a trigger on every write and would still be a
-- number nobody could recompute after a scoring change. This is derived on
-- read, from rows that already exist.
-- ============================================================

-- When somebody actually joined. Null until the call records it — which
-- nothing does yet, so every attended session currently scores as on time.
-- That is the honest default: we cannot call somebody late on evidence we
-- never collected. The grade below starts working the day this is written.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- The score
--
-- Grades, per the agreed scale:
--   turned up on time      1.0
--   turned up late         0.8   (more than ten minutes in)
--   cancelled early        0.8
--   cancelled late         0.4   (inside twelve hours)
--   no-show                0
--
-- Not counted at all:
--   * sessions the OTHER person cancelled — cancelled_by decides whose
--     record it lands on, so one flaky partner cannot drag down everybody
--     they booked with;
--   * proposals that were never confirmed, which is where a reschedule
--     lives: re-proposing a time leaves the old row unconfirmed, so a
--     mutual move costs neither person anything;
--   * past sessions nobody ever marked. An absent verdict is not a verdict
--     of absent — the same rule the Progress page already follows.
--
-- The average is weighted two ways. Recency: the newest session counts fully
-- and each older one 0.9 as much, over a window of the last fifteen, so a bad
-- month eight months ago stops following somebody around. And a prior: every
-- score starts as two invisible sessions at 85%, which is what stops the
-- first cancellation of somebody's life reading as 40% and stops three tidy
-- sessions reading as a perfect 100%.
--
-- Below five graded sessions the percentage is null. There is a real number
-- underneath, but publishing it would be arithmetic pretending to be
-- evidence, and it is somebody's reputation.

-- ============================================================
-- PeerFlow — a weekly goal
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql.
-- Additive: one column. Without it the app assumes two sessions a week and
-- the setting on the profile page quietly does nothing.
--
-- WHY
-- The streak is counted in weeks, and a ring that fills as the week goes is
-- what stops the feedback loop being seven days long — you can see where you
-- stand on Wednesday rather than finding out on Monday. A ring needs a
-- denominator, and the only honest one is a number the person chose.
--
-- Two is the default because one session a week is not a habit and three is
-- most people's aspiration rather than their diary.

-- ============================================================
-- PeerFlow — your own twelve weeks
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql.
-- Additive: one column. Without it the plan is read-only and the Edit
-- button says so rather than appearing and then failing.
--
-- WHY
-- The twelve weeks in plans.js are a default, not a curriculum — the point
-- of them was always that PeerFlow holds the order while somebody else holds
-- the material. A default nobody can change is a curriculum, though, and the
-- person who knows what they need to learn in week seven is the person doing
-- the learning.
--
-- Stored as jsonb rather than a row per week: a plan is read and written as
-- one whole thing, always by one person, and a twelve-row table for that
-- would be a join and a transaction to save a list somebody just retyped.
-- Null means "use the default for my track", which is also what every
-- existing row means today.
-- ============================================================

alter table public.profiles
  add column if not exists plan_weeks jsonb;

-- A plan is a list of strings, and a short one. The check keeps a client bug
-- or a hand-written insert from parking a megabyte of anything in a column
-- every page load reads.
--
-- The per-week rule is written as a jsonpath rather than the `not exists
-- (select ...)` it reads like, because Postgres will not take a subquery in a
-- check constraint. jsonb_path_exists is an ordinary function call, so it is
-- allowed: it asks "is there any element that is not a string, or is longer
-- than 120 characters", and the constraint holds when the answer is no.
--
-- Three details, each of which let something through when it was missing:
--   * `strict` — the default is lax, and lax mode flattens nested arrays, so
--     ["ok", ["nope"]] would be read as two harmless strings.
--   * `flag "s"` — like_regex is XQuery, not POSIX, so `.` skips newlines
--     unless dot-all is on, and 200 newlines would have counted as length 0.
--   * `case` rather than `and` — Postgres does not promise to evaluate AND
--     left to right, and `strict $[*]` against a non-array raises rather than
--     returning false. CASE is short-circuiting by definition, so the type
--     test really does happen first and a bad value fails as a violation
--     instead of an error about jsonpath.

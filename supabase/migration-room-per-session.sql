-- SUPERSEDED — do not run this file.
--
-- Every statement below is already inside supabase/migrate-2026-08.sql, which
-- is the file that gets pasted into the SQL editor. This copy is kept because
-- it is the readable account of one change, and README.md links to it by name
-- to explain what that change was. It is documentation now, not a migration.
--
-- Running it is not a no-op and will not raise an error. These are
-- "create or replace" definitions, so the last paste wins: re-running an old
-- file replaces the current definition of whatever it defines with the older
-- one, silently. Nothing warns you and nothing fails.
--
-- To set a database up, see SETUP_GUIDE.md. The short version is schema.sql,
-- then migration-mvp.sql, then migrate-2026-08.sql, then the migrations
-- written after it that are not folded in yet: migration-reschedule.sql and
-- migration-dormancy.sql.

-- ============================================================
-- One room per session, not one room per partnership.
--
-- room_url was doing two jobs. It is the video room, and it is also
-- the only thing tying a booking's two rows together — which is why
-- answer_session and drop_session key on (starts_at, room_url) — and
-- on top of that it was being used as the partner identifier, because
-- every session with the same person reused the same URL:
--
--     https://meet.jit.si/PeerFlow-<partner_request id>
--
-- That made the URL a standing key to the partnership. Block someone
-- and they still hold a working address for every future call the two
-- of you ever book, because the room name never changes. Jitsi's own
-- guidance is a fresh room name per meeting.
--
-- So the room becomes per-booking and random, and the partnership
-- moves to a column of its own. room_url keeps its other job — it is
-- still shared by a booking's two rows and the two RPCs still key on
-- it — so neither SECURITY DEFINER function changes.
--
-- Safe to run more than once.
-- ============================================================

-- ---------- the partnership, as its own column ----------
alter table public.sessions
  add column if not exists pair_id uuid
  references public.partner_requests(id) on delete set null;

-- Streaks, session counts and the pair's history all filter by partner.
create index if not exists sessions_user_pair on public.sessions (user_id, pair_id);

-- ---------- backfill ----------
-- Every existing row already names its partnership: the room URL is the
-- literal string 'https://meet.jit.si/PeerFlow-' followed by the
-- partner_requests id. Joining on that exact shape rather than parsing a
-- uuid out of the text means a row can only ever be matched to a request
-- that really exists, so the new foreign key cannot be violated — and the
-- older rows built from a user id instead of a request id are simply left
-- null, which every reader already treats as "no partner history".
update public.sessions s
   set pair_id = pr.id
  from public.partner_requests pr
 where s.pair_id is null
   and s.room_url = 'https://meet.jit.si/PeerFlow-' || pr.id::text;

-- Rooms already in the database keep the names they have. Rewriting them
-- would break any session currently in progress and would rename rooms
-- for bookings the other person has already been told about; the point of
-- this change is that the *next* booking gets a fresh room, and from here
-- every booking does.

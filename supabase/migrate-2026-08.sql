-- PeerFlow — everything outstanding, in one paste
--
-- HOW TO RUN IT
-- Supabase → SQL Editor → New query → paste all of this → Run.
-- It takes a few seconds. You should see "Success. No rows returned".
--
-- Safe to run twice. Every statement in here is guarded — `if not exists`,
-- `create or replace`, `drop ... if exists` — so if you already ran some of
-- these separately, running this changes nothing that is already correct.
-- If you are not sure what you have run, run this. That is what it is for.
--
-- It assumes schema.sql and migration-mvp.sql are already in. If the app has
-- ever worked for you, they are.
--
-- WHAT IS IN IT, and what stays broken until you run it
--
--   migration-goal.sql              the weekly goal you pick on your profile.
--                                   Without it the app assumes two sessions a
--                                   week and the setting silently does nothing.
--
--   migration-plan.sql              your own twelve weeks. Without it Edit
--                                   weeks cannot save.
--
--   migration-reliability.sql       the reliability score. Without it no
--                                   percentage appears anywhere.
--
--   migration-room-per-session.sql  one video room per session instead of one
--                                   per partnership. This is the one that
--                                   matters most: until it runs, every session
--                                   with the same person reuses one URL, so the
--                                   room is a standing key to the partnership
--                                   rather than to the booking.
--
-- The four files above are still there and still the source of truth — each
-- one carries the reasoning for what it does. This file is only their contents
-- concatenated in the order they were written, so that running them is one
-- action rather than four. If you edit a migration, rebuild this from the
-- originals rather than editing it here.

-- PeerFlow — a weekly goal
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql.
-- Additive: one column. Without it the app assumes two sessions a week and
-- the setting on the profile page quietly does nothing.
--
-- WHY
-- The streak is counted in weeks, and a ring that fills as the week goes is
-- what stops the feedback loop being seven days long — you can see where you
-- stand on Wednesday rather than finding out on Monday. A ring needs a
-- denominator, and the only honest one is a number the person chose.
--
-- Two is the default because one session a week is not a habit and three is
-- most people's aspiration rather than their diary.

-- PeerFlow — your own twelve weeks
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql.
-- Additive: one column. Without it the plan is read-only and the Edit
-- button says so rather than appearing and then failing.
--
-- WHY
-- The twelve weeks in plans.js are a default, not a curriculum — the point
-- of them was always that PeerFlow holds the order while somebody else holds
-- the material. A default nobody can change is a curriculum, though, and the
-- person who knows what they need to learn in week seven is the person doing
-- the learning.
--
-- Stored as jsonb rather than a row per week: a plan is read and written as
-- one whole thing, always by one person, and a twelve-row table for that
-- would be a join and a transaction to save a list somebody just retyped.
-- Null means "use the default for my track", which is also what every
-- existing row means today.
-- ============================================================

alter table public.profiles
  add column if not exists plan_weeks jsonb;

-- A plan is a list of strings, and a short one. The check keeps a client bug
-- or a hand-written insert from parking a megabyte of anything in a column
-- every page load reads.
--
-- The per-week rule is written as a jsonpath rather than the `not exists
-- (select ...)` it reads like, because Postgres will not take a subquery in a
-- check constraint. jsonb_path_exists is an ordinary function call, so it is
-- allowed: it asks "is there any element that is not a string, or is longer
-- than 120 characters", and the constraint holds when the answer is no.
--
-- Three details, each of which let something through when it was missing:
--   * `strict` — the default is lax, and lax mode flattens nested arrays, so
--     ["ok", ["nope"]] would be read as two harmless strings.
--   * `flag "s"` — like_regex is XQuery, not POSIX, so `.` skips newlines
--     unless dot-all is on, and 200 newlines would have counted as length 0.
--   * `case` rather than `and` — Postgres does not promise to evaluate AND
--     left to right, and `strict $[*]` against a non-array raises rather than
--     returning false. CASE is short-circuiting by definition, so the type
--     test really does happen first and a bad value fails as a violation
--     instead of an error about jsonpath.
alter table public.profiles drop constraint if exists plan_weeks_shape;
alter table public.profiles

    plan_weeks is null or case
      when jsonb_typeof(plan_weeks) <> 'array' then false

-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- PeerFlow — reliability
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql and
-- migration-mvp.sql. Additive: one column and one function. Without it the
-- score simply does not appear anywhere.
--
-- WHY
-- The one thing you need to know about a stranger before you agree to meet
-- them every week is whether they turn up. Everything else on a profile is
-- what they intend to do; this is the only part that is what they did.
--
-- WHY IT IS A FUNCTION AND NOT A COLUMN
-- Reliability is read about other people, and other people's session rows are
-- not readable — the RLS on public.sessions stops there, correctly, because a
-- calendar is private. A security-definer function is the way to answer "how
-- often does this person turn up" without also answering "when are they
-- busy": it returns four numbers per person and never a row.
--
-- A stored column would need a trigger on every write and would still be a
-- number nobody could recompute after a scoring change. This is derived on
-- read, from rows that already exist.
-- ============================================================

-- When somebody actually joined. Null until the call records it — which
-- nothing does yet, so every attended session currently scores as on time.
-- That is the honest default: we cannot call somebody late on evidence we
-- never collected. The grade below starts working the day this is written.
alter table public.sessions
  add column if not exists joined_at timestamptz;


-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- The score
--
-- Grades, per the agreed scale:
--   turned up on time      1.0
--   turned up late         0.8   (more than ten minutes in)
--   cancelled early        0.8
--   cancelled late         0.4   (inside twelve hours)
--   no-show                0
--
-- Not counted at all:
--   * sessions the OTHER person cancelled — cancelled_by decides whose
--     record it lands on, so one flaky partner cannot drag down everybody
--     they booked with;
--   * proposals that were never confirmed, which is where a reschedule
--     lives: re-proposing a time leaves the old row unconfirmed, so a
--     mutual move costs neither person anything;
--   * past sessions nobody ever marked. An absent verdict is not a verdict
--     of absent — the same rule the Progress page already follows.
--
-- The average is weighted two ways. Recency: the newest session counts fully
-- and each older one 0.9 as much, over a window of the last fifteen, so a bad
-- month eight months ago stops following somebody around. And a prior: every
-- score starts as two invisible sessions at 85%, which is what stops the
-- first cancellation of somebody's life reading as 40% and stops three tidy
-- sessions reading as a perfect 100%.
--
-- Below five graded sessions the percentage is null. There is a real number
-- underneath, but publishing it would be arithmetic pretending to be
-- evidence, and it is somebody's reputation.

-- One room per session, not one room per partnership.
--
-- room_url was doing two jobs. It is the video room, and it is also
-- the only thing tying a booking's two rows together — which is why
-- answer_session and drop_session key on (starts_at, room_url) — and
-- on top of that it was being used as the partner identifier, because
-- every session with the same person reused the same URL:
--
--     https://meet.jit.si/PeerFlow-<partner_request id>
--
-- That made the URL a standing key to the partnership. Block someone
-- and they still hold a working address for every future call the two
-- of you ever book, because the room name never changes. Jitsi's own
-- guidance is a fresh room name per meeting.
--
-- So the room becomes per-booking and random, and the partnership
-- moves to a column of its own. room_url keeps its other job — it is

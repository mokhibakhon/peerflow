-- ============================================================
-- SUPERSEDED — do not run this file.
--
-- Every statement below is already inside supabase/migrate-2026-08.sql, which
-- is the file that gets pasted into the SQL editor. This copy is kept because
-- it is the readable account of one change, and README.md links to it by name
-- to explain what that change was. It is documentation now, not a migration.
--
-- Running it is not a no-op and will not raise an error. These are
-- "create or replace" definitions, so the last paste wins: re-running an old
-- file replaces the current definition of whatever it defines with the older
-- one, silently. Nothing warns you and nothing fails.
--
-- To set a database up, see SETUP_GUIDE.md. The short version is schema.sql,
-- then migration-mvp.sql, then migrate-2026-08.sql, then the migrations
-- written after it that are not folded in yet: migration-reschedule.sql and
-- migration-dormancy.sql.

-- ============================================================
-- PeerFlow — a weekly goal
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor, after schema.sql.
-- Additive: one column. Without it the app assumes two sessions a week and
-- the setting on the profile page quietly does nothing.
--
-- WHY
-- The streak is counted in weeks, and a ring that fills as the week goes is
-- what stops the feedback loop being seven days long — you can see where you
-- stand on Wednesday rather than finding out on Monday. A ring needs a
-- denominator, and the only honest one is a number the person chose.
--
-- Two is the default because one session a week is not a habit and three is
-- most people's aspiration rather than their diary.
